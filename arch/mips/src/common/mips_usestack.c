 * Name: up_use_stack
 *
 * Description:
 *   Setup up stack-related information in the TCB using pre-allocated stack
 *   memory.  This function is called only from nxtask_init() when a task or
 *   kernel thread is started (never for pthreads).
 *
 *   The following TCB fields must be initialized:
 *
 *   - adj_stack_size: Stack size after adjustment for hardware,
 *     processor, etc.  This value is retained only for debug
 *     purposes.
 *   - stack_alloc_ptr: Pointer to allocated stack
 *   - adj_stack_ptr: Adjusted stack_alloc_ptr for HW.  The
 *     initial value of the stack pointer.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   - tcb: The TCB of new task
 *   - stack_size:  The allocated stack size.
 *
 *   NOTE:  Unlike up_stack_create() and up_stack_release, this function
 *   does not require the task type (ttype) parameter.  The TCB flags will
 *   always be set to provide the task type to up_use_stack() if it needs
 *   that information.
